# Spain_Population

**Project Domain**: Demography

**Tools used**: Power Query and Power BI

**Project details**: Dashboards created to show the functionalities of Power BI to my students in my Data Analytics class.
  - Data extracted from a PDF published by Universidad de Sevilla. One of the purposes was to show the students how to extract information from a PDF.
  - Data was intensively worked in Power Query (as the original format was friendly for Power BI).
  - Columns were later created using DAX language.
  - Result: an interactive Dashboard that shows the most populated Provinces in Spain in the period 2008-2020. Changed in population growth (and decrease) rates can easily be spotted with the help of a time series visualization.
  
**Programming Languages**: M and Dax.

**Dashboard accessibility**: Both the Dashboard and the original PDF are shaed as part of this repository.

**Project Participation**: I worked independently on this project
